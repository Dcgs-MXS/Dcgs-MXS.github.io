Robot Arms

Today we started using the robot arm. We got to control and use the robot arm using numbers. For example: 0 was move down, 1 was move up, 2 was move to the right and 3 was move to the left. The code was not very complicated, as we just needed to copy the code from the booklet. When we completed the code, we had to position the robot arm in a certain way, by using our hands. The sound it made when we moved the arm one position was a click. We got worried as we thought we had broken the arm and we would have to pay for it. But then we found out that we supposed to do that to get it in the right position. When we were controlling the arm, we tried to get it to pick up a rubber, and it worked! We then tried getting it to pick up my finger and it also worked, but I could get it loose easily. Because of course, this puny robot was no match for my muscular figure!
