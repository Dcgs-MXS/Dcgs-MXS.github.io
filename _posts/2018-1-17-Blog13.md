BLOG 13


17/1/18

Today we continued doing python. Mr Keen talked to us a lot about key terms such as strings, variables and print. He also talked to us about how boys in Challoners mindsets are not right, and how they never try to figure it out for ourselves. He also asked if anyone had a maid to clean their bedroom, no-one did. He told us this story about when he went to Mc Donalds and asked they staff if he could have twelve chicken nuggets and they said no because they only serve six, nine and twenty. Then eventually he asked for fifteen chicken nuggets and how the staff could not do six plus nine to fifteen. The story went on for a bit, and they manager came out. But the point of the story was how some people can only follow set instructions. Eventually, we went back to the topic of IT, and he told us about Codecademy and what it does. Mr Keen told us we have to do this for homework every week as well as the blog. He then showed us the first few exercises on there and he told us what you do on there. We asked a few questions about it, for example: what does the two equals signs mean ==, and why are the variables different colours to other variables in other programs? After that, the bell went and it was time to pack up.
