BLOG 17


This blog will be short as I was only in for half the lesson, and the half I was in, I could not concentrate properly. At the bell signaling the end of break, I was involved in an incident invloving Year 9's and my head. In the end I had a severe nose bleed and a very big headache. I went straight from matron to IT 1, I made the  executive  descision to not grab my planner and pencil case from my locker as I was already thirty minutes late to the lesson. When I got into the class, Mr Keen was talking about turtles and I was very confused. We then went on Repl.it and created an infinite amount of shapes using turtle code. After that, it was the end of the lesson.
