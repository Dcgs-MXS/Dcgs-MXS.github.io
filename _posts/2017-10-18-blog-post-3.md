Lesson Review
How did I learn? What strategies were effective?
Today i have learnt  a lot more about the fuzebox and about the functions. Me and my partner have done a massive amount of work, more than we had expected. We bth agreed that reading our code and the instructions gave us a more chance of getting it right as last week we made a lot of unwanted mistakes. My partner and me took turns checking and writing the code so we both wonâ€™t fight or get the code wrong. This was a strategy that made our work get finished much quicker. 
What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? 
I personally think that we had much limitations between us, apart from the slight argument of what memory stick to store the work on. We both feel as if we have gone an extra mile in our work and we both agree that we will continue doing that. This also let us have time to our blogs therefore we had a lot less homework to do when we worked as a team.
What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?
Me and my partner, Harris both want to work more progressively and try getting more work done, we also will read the code more carefully and try adding in our own information and items so we can impress the teachers more.
