BLOG 20

Today will be another short blog. We only did Codecademy today, but I progressed quite a bit. I started off the lesson in the middle of Python lists and dictonaries, which is the start of the lists and dictionaries catergory. I had to go to the start of the lesson, to see what I was doing and to remember how to do it. At the end of the lesson I finished at around half way through A day at the supermarket, which is also in lists and dictionaries. A day at the supermarket is about storing the costs of variables and the stock of them. For homework I completed A day at the supermarket and got a bit less than a third way through the next exercise. The python gets increasingly harder as it goes along, and I will probably have to go through some of the previous exercise, because it is no point if I cannot remember the basics.
