LED Lights

Today we started LED Lights. We heard from other groups that the LED's didn't actually work and they just wasted time. It took us a long time to set it up as it was very complicated. It was very complicated as we had to type a lot of code and we had to plug in the thin wires and the LED's. It took us around 20 minutes to plug it all in and write the code, i typed the code, my partner put the wires in place. After we set it all up, we prayed (non religiously) that it would work, and it did! We then made it flash 3 different coloured lights all at different times. After that, we didn't want to mess with our carefully made code, that took us a long time to make, so we saved it onto a memory stick and made another copy so we can just mess around on another copy and not mess up our work. After that, we put the new memory stick back and packed up.
