Today§was§our§last§IT§lesson§before§christmas. The§lesson§was§only§a§bit§different§because§we§were§allowed§to§'test'§the §games§and§try§and§make§them§using§the§fuze§boxes. We chose the game 'Snake' as it looked much easier compared to the other games. It was not. We spent about 30 minutes copying out the lines and lines and lines of code, that was very boring. Then we played the semi built game and it was kind of rubbish. I drifted off to my own computer and started to improve my blog. Firstly, I went to the IT section of the challoners website to see if I could find the instructions on how to make a table in my blog. I couldn't find it, so I decided to do something else with my blog. I tried adding this weird symbol to my blog to try and make it look cool, I don't know if it worked. I then changed my background to a random and funny gif. After that it was the end of the lesson.
