Title
Python Week 1
Date
10/01/18
Starting point:
We learnt the basics of python
Target for this lesson?
To print hello world 
Did I reach my target? 
Yes i reached my target today
How did you use your learning habits this week?
Persevering
I didn’t give up after i made a mistake by not putting the the speech marks before and after hello world.
Questioning?
I questioned what was on the board about the asterixes as I didn’t know.
Independence
I didn’t ask for any “help” today.
Reflecting
I understand what went wrong and the key terms they use like the syntax error.
Engagement
I found it very interesting and I can't wait to do more python. 
What could have gone better in your learning?
I wish that we could have had more time in class to do more python and coding as I find this very fun. As well as this I could have checked my work as I did make a mistake which I did learn from as it was a syntax error.
What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?
I think I should double check my code next time as I didn’t today when we were printing “Hello World”. I also need to concentrate more and not always look at the board to see if there is anything new as it wastes time.
