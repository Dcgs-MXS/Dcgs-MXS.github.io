Lesson Review
How did I learn? What strategies were effective?
Me and harris both agreed that we should not stumble at the first hurdle as we did encounter a part where we couldn't retrieve our work from last lesson but after asking a bit of help from Listy we figured it out. Soon we wrote some code that didn't work and we could not find out the problem then matt aldrid told and found out that we had completely missed a line of code.
What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? 
A big problem that me and harris encounter is that we ask for help too much even though our mistake was really quite simple like the line of code missing. Next time we wonâ€™t ask for help as much and we will try our best to figure out our own problems as hard as it gets.
What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?
We will not ask for help as much and figure out the problems that we face as hard as it gets. This has came up a lot in the recent weeks that we have been in IT.
