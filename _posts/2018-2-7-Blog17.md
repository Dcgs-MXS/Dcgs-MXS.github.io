BLOG 17

Today was the last lesson before a week long half term and halfway through the year! This will be a short blog because we only did one thing for the entire lesson. Mr Keen told us to get as far as we could into Codecadeamy before the end of the lesson. He then left and Mr Clayton came in as our cover teacher. We then just went on codecademy for the rest of the lesson. I went from the last stage of strings and console input to the very start of functions. I found all of it quite challenging, and just a bit hard. I made sure i read the first box, explaning what the topic is before rushing onto the instructions. On the later topics I sometimes had to get a hint as i did not really understand what I was supposed to do. I found the upper and lowercase parts the hardest and I found the printing strings part quite easy.
