Lesson Review
How did I learn? What strategies were effective?
Today I have deleted my repository on github. After i finished this created a new one, so after looking back to my old blogs and I figured it out. I first forked the jekyll-now and then i chose my new profile picture. I figured to make a new background so that my blog would be more colorful and so my blog wouldnâ€™t be so dull.
What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? 
Unfortunately i had to move into IT2 along with Alistair and Harris. I had to relog onto the computer which wasted time, as well as this i only had half of the lesson as we got the timetable mixed up so all of the students, including me, in 8W went to drama not knowing that we need to go to IT.
What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?
I think that i do not think i can improve apart from working faster as i worked at a reasonable pace as well as getting the same amount of the work that the students around me had achieved.
