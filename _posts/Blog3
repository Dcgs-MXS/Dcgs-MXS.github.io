Target: To get to the next stage in the booklet
Mission failed

My partner and I start off by trying to plug everything into the fuze box. We found out that the mouse, power cable and HDMI cables all worked but it was coming up with a foreign language sign on the monitor. We then tried plugging it into a different monitor (we hadn’t realised that it was the fuze box that was broken) and the same sign popped up. We then tried switching the power socket cable around but that didn’t work either. We kept on switching the cables around and swapping to different monitors, but eventually we came to the solution that we were not IT support, and asked Mr Cullen for help.
After he had poked around at it, switching the cables around (much for efficiently than us) he came to the conclusion that the fuze box was broken. So we quickly put all the cables we had unplugged back to its original place. We then gave it to Mr Keen and he told us to join another group. 
When we joined, we did the same thing we would have done if it was just us, but with 2 other people.

I think we did the right thing by trying everything we could think of before asking a teacher.
