Did I reach my target? 
Yes 
Lesson Review
How did I learn? What strategies were effective?
Today i have ahow to use the fuzebox. I had to set it up by changing the hdmi cables and i had to add in the mouse. I spent most of my time messing around and finding new thing ad that is what we were challenged to do. In my class my group was the first to get the fuzebox up and running. My group consisted of me Harris and Trian.
What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? 
.The first code that me and my group trid did unfortunately not work but with a little help from matt aldrid we managed to get the code working. We had made the fuzebox say hello continuously until we press esc F2. 
What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?
I will not ask for help straight away and i will only ask for it if i have tried a lot and done different methods. I will also hope that our code will work first time and it will not keep causing distractions.
