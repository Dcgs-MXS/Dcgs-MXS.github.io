First blog

Today was the first IT lesson of year 9 amd we had the first lesson with Mr Tansley. First of all, he talked to us about year 9 computing and what it consisted of. He then told us to go on Google sheets and he asked us what Caesar Cypher was without looking it up. Only James new because he looked it up. It is a form of code that was used by Caesar to send messages without them getting deciphered. The process - you get a letter ( A ) and the letter in the code is 3 letters back so the answer is 
( X ). If the letter was H the coded letter would be E. So hello would be EBIIL. We were told to write these out so we could remember them. Then Mr Tansley said there was a quicker way than writing it in so that the computer could just do it for you. He showed us this way and then told us to do it, but I didn't understand it so hipefully we will go through it next lesson.
