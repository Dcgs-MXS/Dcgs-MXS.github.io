Today we made our own animations. Yesterday, Mr Cullen told us for homework, to make our own animation, so that we could start the actual coding in school. We were told to do a 'I','heart' and then whatever you love. For my animation I put a badminton racket because I love badminton, CE (which is the name of my badminton club(Chalfont Eagles)) and finally an Oakland Raiders symbol as they are my favourite american football team. Me and my partner took it in turns to do each of our animations. (All of his were to do with CHEESE!)
