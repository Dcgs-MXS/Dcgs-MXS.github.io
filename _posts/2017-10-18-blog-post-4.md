Lesson Review
How did I learn? What strategies were effective?
. We worked together as a team and completed the code for it to say that it was raspberry pie. Our second mission was to make it ask questions that you can answer like how old are you and what hobbies do you have. We both used perseverance and we did not ask for help straight away once we had contact with an issue.
What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? 
 The problem that we faced limited our learning as it took a lot of our time. We had help from Mr Cullen but we still could not figure out the issue, this led us to ask keenan and edgar who thankfully came across the same issue but found the issue and had managed to solve it and told us why.
What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?
We will improve by learning to find out the problem quickly and not always rely on the book as it did have a few silly mistakes. Perhaps we could ask our classmates more earlier so that we could get more work done in the 1 hour period of time.
