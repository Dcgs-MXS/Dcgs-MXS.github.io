Lesson Review
How did I learn? What strategies were effective? 
I learnt by remembering what I did last year and referring to the google classroom presentation that was posted. I also got a few reminders and tips from the person next to me.
What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? 
The thing that limited my learning was the fact that I hadn't done this in quite a while, due to summer break. Also the fact that me and my whole class going to the wrong lesson because of our time tables being incorrect made it so I missed what we were doing because i wasn’t here for the first half of the lesson.
What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?
Next time I won’t go to wrong lesson and I  try to work it out for myself instead of asking the person next to me immediately.
