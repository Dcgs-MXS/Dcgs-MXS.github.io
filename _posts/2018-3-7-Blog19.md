BLOG 19


Today will be a short blog, as there is not so much to write about. First we started going on repl.it for a small bit, quickly improving our shape, but hen almost immediatley we were told to go on Codecademy. At the start of the lesson my progress was a little higher that 35 percent, nearly completed the Functions section, and by the end of the lesson I got on to the 2nd exercise of lists and dictionaries. The python syllubas clearly gets harder as it goes along. Mr Keen was wondering around the room, offering help if we could not get it from the hint. We did this till the end of the lesson.
