After the succsesses of last week, we decided to move onto the next chapter and discover the world of variables. The variables work we did was stuff like how old are you, insert age, wow you are very old/wow your very young. My partners favourite question was 'would you eat cheese and curry mashed together in a pot and basil on the side'. The answers were yes or no, and we had to include something if you said yes 'jeez that is manky' and no 'well done, you are a bery sophisticated person, give yourself a pat on the back'. We also made other questions and messed about with the variables, like when you do the assessment for each chapter, where we had to make a short conversation. In the conversation you had to make the computer be able to respond to random text e.g COMPUTER: HOW OLD ARE YOU? PERSON: ORANGES. COMPUTER: WOW! YOUR WEIRD! After we had finished doing the assessment, we saved our work onto a memory stick and packed up.
