Yes.


Lesson Review
How did I learn? What strategies were effective? 
My partner and I were quite good at doing this, not that we had done it before, but the only thing you had to do was read the instruction booklet as they had all the information you need to complete the task. My partner and I got on to the “I have 6 apples” section, and did a little bit of that , then it was the end of the lesson.




What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?
Next time I won't play around or experiment as much on some of the earlier parts, so I can progress further, to maybe completing the “I have 6 apples” section.
