FUZE BOXES


Today we used fuze boxes, completely new and interesting and much different to what we had done before. We spent at least half an hour to talk about it and at least ten minutes to set it up, so we only got around ten minutes to play around with it. We were given a fuze box manual that had instructions inside of it. It also told us what the purpose of the fuze box was for. By the end of the lesson, we had only just started typing code in because we were reading the manual for most of the lesson. After that we just packed away, and that was the end of the lesson.
