Today we continued to use repl.it Our homework from last week was to find out and produce something cool on the python shape making tool.  I made a multi coloured turtle that flashes random colours, make thousands of identical pentagons, each one getting bigger and bigger as it went along. We were told to open what we did for homework, and move around the room, taking notes on whose animation was the coolest. Mr Keen quite liked mine because of the flashing random colours. A few other teachers, including Mr Silvester walked in and viewed our work. He quite liked mine he said. After we finished, we were supposed to nominate whose design was the best, I chose Emmanuel's plain design, which was literally just a drawn smiley face, but I still liked it. We then listen to Mr Keen, and we were told to make a start on creating a new shape, his example was a hazard symbol and the start of a rose. I then created what was supposed to be a rose, but failed.
