Today we carried on doing variables. This time we created code for taking away. e.g I HAVE 6 APPLES, I EAT ONE, I HAVE 5 APPLES LEFT, I EAT ONE, I HAVE 4 APPLES LEFT, I EAT ONE, I HAVE 3 APPLES LEFT, I EAT ONE, I HAVE  2 APPLES LEFT, I EAT ONE, I HAVE 1 APPLE LEFT, I EAT ONE, I HAVE 0 APPLES LEFT. That part of code took around 35 minutes, so we had a bit of time left so we changed 'apples' to 'cheese slices' and made a sentence at the end when you have run out of 'cheese slices', saying something like OH NO! Near the end of the lesson, when we started to pack up, we couldn't find our memory stick! We vigourisly searched through the memory stick back in panic, because all of our work was on their. We couldn't find it in the end, so we had to get a new one from the bag, this time we got a bright purple memory stick. We got that one so we didn't forget which stick it is and to we can find it quickly.
