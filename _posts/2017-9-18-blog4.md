BLOG POST 4


Today was our fourth lesson (2nd proper lesson, as we missed half of one, and our box wasn't working) and we started looking at defchar and what it did. We found out it was used for animations and we got quite excited. We thought it would be really cool animations, like disney or at least anime but that was not the case. There was a lot of code that we had to copy from the textbook, and me and my partner took turns writing it. But in the end it was actually quite rewarding as we completed the space invader animation. We then experimented with other animations but it really didn't work. This was our first lesson were we actually saved the work onto a borrowed memory stick, so this was the first recorded code we did. We then discovered what the numbers actually meant, and what the different lines were for. By then of the lesson Mr Cullen set homework to create your own animation and add up the numbers to get the correct defchar. After that we packed away.
