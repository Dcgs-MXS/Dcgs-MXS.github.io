Today was our fourth python lesson, and the last day of January. It was my first day back from Cologne, as I was ill on Tuesday, so i was very tired and feeling a bit sick. I struggled through the first two periods and through the third (IT) with slight difficulty. Today we had a talk with Mr Keen about Binary and counting and multiplying in it, this was in base 2. When you get to 2, you move the one to the next column so that it looks like 10, but it is just 2. And you make 3 with 11, not eleven. He taught us how to make bigger numbers with it, like 129 (10000001) and 1.5 (1.1). The binary convertion is much harder as it invloves many numbers for only a simple decimal, but luckily, we dont count in binary or base 2, we count in base 10. Mr Keen also told us that our highest digit is 9, because we make every number with: zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight and nine. After that, we went onto repl.it and used the the function def a bit, we did maths with it although i did not really understand it.
