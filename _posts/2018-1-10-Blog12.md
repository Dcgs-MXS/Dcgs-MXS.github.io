Today was our first lesson back from the christmas holidays. Firstly, we lined up outside of the drama studios because everyone thought it was drama that we were supposed to be having. It took about 5 minutes for the drama teacher to come out of his room. Then it took another ten minutes for him to tell us that our group was not supposed to be in this group, the other group was though. Then we got back to IT 1 and it was already twent minutes into the lesson. We chose a seat, logged on and joined the new google classroom. We found out that we were doing Python, and my heart sunk. Apparently python is very hard, and it is very long and boring. We went to the front and we ordered the steps on how to make a fried egg. Then he taught us some simple and common phrases used in python. These were words like syntax. He then told us of a website that will alow us to type in any code and it will show us what it comes up with on the screen. We can now use it as a testing thing where if we are not sure if the code is right, we can test it there. We typed the basic thing like: print ('HELLO WORLD!'). After that, the bell rung, and the lesson was over.
