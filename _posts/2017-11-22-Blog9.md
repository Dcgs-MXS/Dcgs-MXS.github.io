LED's.

Today we carried on doing LED's, but did something else with them. We created a light detector and a burglar alarm. We started with the light detector, which took us a long time to write in the code and put the wires and LED's in place. I wrote the code, whilst my partner plugged in the wires. This process took around fifteen to twenty minutes, as there was a lot of code. In the end we were very happy with the result as it was quite cool. If you put your hand over the detector, the numbers on the screen decreased, and when you take it off, the numbers turn high. The light detector even worked with paper, so we messed around with that for a while. After that we did the burglar alarm. Luckily, some part of the code was the same, so we could just copy and paste it and write the other code aswell. The wire and LED placing was also quite easy, so it didn't take much time. The end result was quite impressive, because the burglar alarm actually worked. If you put a piece of paper or a slim enough object in front of the detector, the LED light would start to flash. We weren't able to put our hands between them to set it off, as it was a too small gap. After that, we saved our work onto the memory stick and packed up.
